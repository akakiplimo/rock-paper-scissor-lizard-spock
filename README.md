# Rock-paper-scissor-lizard-spock NextJS Challenge

### Objective

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Use JavaScript and NextJS.

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version or the `bonus` designs for the harder version. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for. You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
-   Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
-   Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
-   **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

### Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

-   Rock beats Scissors
-   Scissors beats Paper

#### Bonus

-   Scissors beats Paper

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
